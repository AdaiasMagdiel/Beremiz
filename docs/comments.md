# Comments

Comments in Beremiz serve to annotate code and provide additional information
without affecting the program's execution.

## Single Line Comments

Single line comments can be inserted using the `#` character. They will be
ignored by the interpreter.

Example:

```beremiz
# This is a single line comment
```

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments can be inserted between `#[` and `]#`.

Example:

```beremiz
#[
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
]#
```
