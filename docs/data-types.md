# Tables

Tables can be created using square brackets `[]` to delimit elements, separated by commas `,`. Tables can contain elements of different types.

Example:

```beremiz
[1, 2, 3, "avocado", "banana", "cashew", true, false, nil] show
```

This will create a table with integers, strings, booleans, and nil values. The `show` keyword will display the table and remove it from the stack.

Tables are useful for storing collections of data and can be manipulated using various stack operations.
